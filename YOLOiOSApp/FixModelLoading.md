# Fix Model Loading Error

## The Issue
The app crashes with "Model file not found" error because the ML model files are not included in the app bundle.

## Model Files Location
The project has these model files:
- `/YOLOiOSApp/DetectModels/yolo11n.mlpackage`
- `/YOLOiOSApp/SegmentModels/yolo11n-seg.mlpackage`
- `/YOLOiOSApp/ClassifyModels/yolo11n-cls.mlpackage`
- `/YOLOiOSApp/PoseModels/yolo11n-pose.mlpackage`
- `/YOLOiOSApp/OBBModels/yolo11n-obb.mlpackage`

## Solution

### In Xcode:

1. **Add Model Files to Project**
   - Right-click on YOLOiOSApp group in Xcode
   - Select "Add Files to YOLOiOSApp..."
   - Navigate to each model folder (DetectModels, SegmentModels, etc.)
   - Select the .mlpackage files
   - Make sure "Copy items if needed" is UNCHECKED
   - Make sure "YOLOiOSApp" target is CHECKED
   - Click "Add"

2. **Verify in Build Phases**
   - Select YOLOiOSApp project
   - Select YOLOiOSApp target
   - Go to "Build Phases" tab
   - Expand "Copy Bundle Resources"
   - Verify that the .mlpackage files are listed there

3. **Alternative: Add Only One Model**
   If you want to keep the app size small, add just one model:
   - Add only `yolo11n.mlpackage` from DetectModels folder

## Temporary Workaround
If you can't add models to Xcode right now, you can modify the code to handle missing models gracefully instead of crashing.
